- **User-Friendly API**: Easy-to-use interface that simplifies the integration of machine learning into your chemistry workflows.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation to guide users through installation, usage, and examples.
- **Community Support**: Join a growing community of researchers and developers contributing to the field of chemistry and machine learning.

## Installation

To get started with FAIR Chemistry, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/Somanhussain/fairchem/releases). Simply download the appropriate package for your system, extract it, and follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation.

### Requirements

Before installing, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

Once you have installed the library, you can start using it in your projects. Here’s a basic example of how to load a dataset and apply a machine learning model.

```python
import fairchem

# Load your dataset
data = fairchem.load_data('your_dataset.csv')

# Preprocess the data
processed_data = fairchem.preprocess(data)

# Train a model
model = fairchem.train_model(processed_data)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```

## Examples

To illustrate the capabilities of FAIR Chemistry, we provide several examples that showcase different use cases of the library. You can find these examples in the `examples` directory of the repository.

### Example 1: Predicting Molecular Properties

In this example, we demonstrate how to predict molecular properties using regression techniques. This can be particularly useful in materials science and drug discovery.

```python
import fairchem

# Load molecular dataset
molecular_data = fairchem.load_data('molecular_data.csv')

# Train a regression model
regression_model = fairchem.train_regression_model(molecular_data)

# Evaluate model performance
performance = fairchem.evaluate_model(regression_model)
print(performance)
```

### Example 2: Classification of Chemical Compounds

This example focuses on classifying chemical compounds based on their features. You can use this method to categorize compounds for various applications.

```python
import fairchem

# Load chemical compound dataset
compound_data = fairchem.load_data('compound_data.csv')

# Train a classification model
classification_model = fairchem.train_classification_model(compound_data)

# Make predictions on new compounds
classification_predictions = classification_model.predict(new_compounds)
print(classification_predictions)
```
